The data flow of real-time data in DECADA Data Asset Management can be viewed through 3 key capabilities:
- Stream Analytics (i.e. Stream Processing, Batch Processing)
- Storage Management & Access (i.e. Time Series Database TSDB, Data Archiving, Data Federation)
- Data Governance (i.e. Data Subscription Services)

**<u>Before You Start</u>**

To leverage on the following services for better data management, Agencies will need to have an account and access to the corresponding services If Agencies do not have the access, please contact GovTech for the creation of account with the necessary functionality access.

**<u>Stream Processing Services</u>**

Powered by Apache SparkTM Streaming, DECADA Stream Analytics targets to meet the real-time data processing requirement of devices and assets where it can be used for the following scenarios:

- Aggregating and calculating asset raw data
- Computation of device state

<div align=center>

</div>

By leveraging on such service, Agencies will be ensured of the following:
- High throughput and low latency stream processing.
- Commonly used stream processing algorithms in the IoT field.
- Visualized template-based configurations to help Agencies quickly perform their stream data processing jobs.
- A set of underlying packaged StreamSets operators for developers to develop customized stream data processing jobs to meet the requirements of complex business scenarios. Agencies may refer here for more information on the existing StreamSets operators.

?> Agencies can leverage on existing API/SDK and the DECADA Management Portal to create the analytics pipeline to meet the real-time data processing requirement of devices and assets

**<u>Via DECADA Management Portal</u>**

Agencies may refer [here](https://www.envisioniot.com/docs/stream-processing/en/latest/gettingstarted_ai.html) for the implementation details via the DECADA Management Portal.

**<u>Via API Calls</u>**

Agencies may refer [here](https://support.envisioniot.com/docs/stream-processing-api/en/2.3.0/overview.html) for the implementation details via the existing API calls.

**<u>Batch Processing Service</u>**

DECADA provides Dataflow Service that enables batch data processing based on scheduled workflows. The batch data processing operations support various scenarios from simple data transformation to complete ETL (extract-transform-load). The Batch Processing Service also provides common libraries out-of-the-box for most frequently used data processing operations.

?> Agencies can leverage on existing API/SDK and the DECADA Management Portal to manage the data synchronization, data development, and workflow operation tasks for batch data processing.

**<u>Via DECADA Management Portal</u>**

Agencies may refer [here](https://www.envisioniot.com/docs/batch-processing/en/latest/managing_resource.html) for the implementation details via the DECADA Management Portal.

**<u>Via API Calls</u>**

Agencies may refer [here](https://www.envisioniot.com/docs/batch-processing-api/en/latest/v2.1/overview.html) for the implementation details via the existing API calls.



**<u>Time Series Data Management (TSDB)</u>**

The Time Series Database (TSDB) provides efficient and stable storage and management for time series data that is ingested from devices or generated by the stream processing engine by having a variety of data storage options based on Agencies' data storage and reading requirements. It allows Agencies to view the latest data ingested from devices via the Data Insights feature and delete historical data via the Data Deletion feature.

?> 1. The data storage policy must be configured before the devices start uploading data to DECADA. Otherwise, the uploaded device data will not be stored in TSDB. 2. Agencies can leverage on existing API/SDK and the DECADA Management Portal to query and update related storage resources.

**<u>Via DECADA Management Portal</u>**

Agencies may refer [here](https://www.envisioniot.com/docs/time-series-data/en/latest/policy.html) for the implementation details via the DECADA Management Portal.

**<u>Via API Calls</u>**

Agencies may refer below for the implementation details via the existing API calls.

- [TSDB Policy Service:](https://support.envisioniot.com/docs/tsdb-policy-api/en/2.3.0/v2.1/overview.html) To query and update TSDB Storage Policies
- [TSDB Data Service:](https://support.envisioniot.com/docs/tsdb-data-api/en/2.3.0/v2.1/v21.html) Query assets data that is stored in the DECADA TSDB and filter/aggregate the data based on use-case

**<u>Data Archiving Service</u>**

DECADA supports archiving and storing data from the real-time message channel, data from the offline message channels, real-time alert records, and data stored in TSDB. It provides flexible storage configurations to reduce Agencies data storage costs.

Agencies may refer [here](https://www.envisioniot.com/docs/data-archiving/en/latest/archive_policy.html)for more information.

**<u>Data Federation Service</u>**

DECADA provides data reading and writing services from and to multi-source heterogeneous data storage systems. Agencies can read data from and write data to heterogeneous data sources through unified SQL statements.

?> Agencies can leverage on existing API/SDK and the DECADA Management Portal to manage data federation channels, and read data from or write data to multi-source heterogeneous data storage systems.

**<u>Via DECADA Management Portal</u>**

Agencies may refer [here](https://www.envisioniot.com/docs/data-federation/en/latest/index.html) for the implementation details via the DECADA Management Portal.

**<u>Via API Calls</u>**

Agencies may refer [here](https://support.envisioniot.com/docs/data-federation-api/en/2.3.0/overview.html) for the implementation details via the existing API calls.
 
**<u>Data Subscription Services</u>**

Agencies can subscribe to both the original and the calculated data, so that the asset data can be consumed by Agencies' application directly The subscription setting can be configured though the Data Subscription function in the DECADA Management Portal and existing API.
