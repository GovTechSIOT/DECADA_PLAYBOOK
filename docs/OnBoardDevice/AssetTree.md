**Managing Asset Tree**

Asset tree is a key function of the Asset Management service of DECADA. Asset tree is mainly for asset owners who understand the enterprise asset management business where they can quickly create the asset topology to manage assets in the cloud.

?> Agencies can leverage on either existing API/SDK or the DECADA Management Portal to create the Assets Tree

**<u>Before you Start</u>**

To create an asset tree, Agencies will need to have an account and write access to the Asset Tree services. If Agencies do not have the access, please contact GovTech for the creation of account with the necessary functionality access.

**<u>Via DECADA Management Portal</u>**

Agencies may refer [here](https://www.envisioniot.com/docs/device-connection/en/latest/howto/asset_tree/assettree_overview) for the details to create and utilize the assets tree via the DECADA Management Portal.
