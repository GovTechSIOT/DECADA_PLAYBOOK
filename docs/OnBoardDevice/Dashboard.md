**<u>Overview</u>**

Once the devices has been provision on DECADA, Agencies can:-
- Gain an overview of their device inventory and message dynamics (i.e. real-time statistics of device behaviors and connections such as device event reporting  failures, number of message sent by and the network status of devices)
- Develop their own application for data presentation 
via the dashboarding functions.

**<u>Via DECADA Management Portal</u>**

To review and develop your own application for data presentation , Agencies will need to have a DECADA Management Portal account. If Agencies do not have the access, please contact GovTech for the creation of account with the necessary functionality access.
