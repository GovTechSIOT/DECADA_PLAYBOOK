Air Guard Project 1

The proposed project involves the development of an IoT Device Management Platform for the monitoring and actuation of data for NEAâ€™s Toxic Gases Detection System. The Edge Gateway System shall be responsible for interfacing with an Airguard devices situated on-site and providing a secured interface for upstream/downstream communication with DECADA.  NEA can access sensor information via Internet through GCC where the security aspect is taken care by GovTech.
