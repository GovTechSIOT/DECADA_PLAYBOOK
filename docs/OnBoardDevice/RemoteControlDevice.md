<h1>Remote Controlling of Devices</h1>

DECADA also has the functions which allows Agencies to control their devices remotely from:
- Directly from DECADA
- 3rd Party Application owned by Agencies

?> Agencies can leverage on existing API/SDK and the DECADA Management Portal to control their on-boarded devices remotely.

**<u>Before You Start</u>**

To control the devices remotely, Agencies will need to have an account with the necessary rights access. If Agencies do not have the access, please contact GovTech.

**<u>Via DECADA Management Portal</u>**

Agencies can control their on-boarded devices via the DECADA Management Portal:

<div align=center>
<name=Device Management Dashboard>

</div>

**<u>Via API Calls</u>**
