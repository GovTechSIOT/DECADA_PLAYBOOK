The Edge Gateway System shall be responsible for interfacing with an Airguard devices situated on-site and providing a secured interface for upstream/downstream communication with DECADA.  Agency can access sensor information via Internet through GCC where the security aspect is taken care by GovTech.

The DECADA Cloud together with the SNSP Solutioning (i.e SDX) shall also interface with Agency system to provide monitoring and actuation features. It will also allow Agency to access sensor information via SG-WAN on GSIB Laptop.
