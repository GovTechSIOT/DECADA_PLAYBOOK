# Integration with WOG Smart Nation Sensor Platform

**<u>Overview</u>**

Agencies can enjoy seamless integration with the various SNSP’s solution (i.e. Asynchronous Data Exchange, ADEX) via DECADA. Agencies will only have to raise a Service Request (SR) to input their requirement for data sharing. 

Not only does the architecture of the integration of the SNSP’s initiative with DECADA is AIAS compliance, Agencies will not be required to manage the security aspect of the connection. The GovTech GSNOC will be overseeing the security aspect of the set-up instead.

?>Agencies can contact GovTech for more information.
