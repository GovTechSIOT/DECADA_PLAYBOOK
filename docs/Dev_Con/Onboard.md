# Planning and Provisioning

## Integration with DECADA

### Introduction on Integration to DECADA
 
**<u>Overview</u>**

DECADA provides several connection solutions for Agencies to connect sensors to DECADA. The first step to determine which solution to use is to check whether the device to connect meets the following two conditions.

  - Supports TCP/UDP communication.
  - Supports the data format of the EnOS device connection protocol through firmware upgrade.

If the device meets both conditions, the device can be directly connected to DECADA.
If the device does not meet either of the conditions and is connected to another system or cloud platform, Agencies should refer to the “Cloud-to-Cloud” method to connect to DECADA. 

Communications to DECADA can be done via any one of the following methods:

<div align=center>
<img width="850" src="./images/integration_with_decada.png"/>
</div>

**<u>Mode of Connection</u>**

**1. Direct Connection**

Agencies can leverage on this mode of connection if the sensors is able to communicate to DECADA via SDKs and/or MQTT/CoAP/HTTPS. For more information, please refer [here](https://siotteam.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DUG/pages/2284191770/Direct+Connection). 
 
**2. Connect through on-site/Cloud Edg Gateway**

Agencies can leverage on this mode of connection by deploying a physical/cloud edge if the sensors has limited capabilities. For more information, please refer [here](https://siotteam.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DUG/pages/2284322826/Connection+Via+Edge). 
 
**3. Connect through Cloud**

Agencies can leverage on this mode of connection if they have an existing application residing in Cloud and wish to integrate with DECADA or where direct link to DECADA is not possible. For more information, please refer [here](https://siotteam.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DUG/pages/2284814349/Cloud-to-Cloud+Connection). 


### Direct Connection

<div align=center>
<img width="850" src="./images/snsp.png"/>
</div>

**Using Device SDK**

Direct connection can be made via the use of GovTech provided SDKs which are available in
Java, Python 2/3 and C/C++. The device SDKs encapsulate protocols for data transmission and provide features such as device registration, device data ingestion and device control.

Supported platforms include x86 and ARM. DECADA’s SDKs are all open source in nature, and are available for reference [here](https://siotteam.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DUG/pages/2263220229/DECADA+SDK+API). Need to confirm this link. Faultly link(!) will be fixed

This option is applicable only for sensors with the capability for direct access. There are a few scenarios for direct connection:
  - Connected device is registered, and the device is burned with a **unique** product and device keys provided by DECADA portal. This scenario is mainly for **small number of devices**, and the device is burned with device triple (product key, device key and device secret key) through cloud registration.

  - Connected devices are registered, and devices are burned with the **same** product information (product key and product secret key) in batch. Agencies to call the REST API to register the devices in batch and once they are connected to the network they will be automatically connect to the cloud.


**Non-SDK Methods**

If the device SDKs provided by GovTech cannot meet Agencies’s requirements, Agencies can choose to send telemetries based on DECADA's device protocol standards. The supported protocols are as follows:

  - <u>MQTT Based Protocol:</u>
  Device Protocol for MQTT defines the data format of the MQTT-based transmission between devices and DECADA.
    Agencies need to ensure that the MQTT clients running on their devices support minimally MQTT v3.1.1, secret-based one-way authentication for unclassified data and certificate-based two-way authentication for restricted data.
Details of implementation can be found [here](https://support.envisioniot.com/docs/device-connection/en/latest/learn/connection_protocols/enos_mqtt).

  - <u>CoAP Based Protocol:</u>
    The Constrained Application Protocol is a protocol designed for use in low-power embedded environments. DECADA exposes a set of APIs which can be accessed via CoAP and devices can connect into the DECADA cloud platform as long as the data format conforms to the standard.
Details of implementation can be found [here](https://support.envisioniot.com/docs/device-connection/en/latest/learn/connection_protocols/enos_coap).

   - <u>RESTful API via HTTPS:</u>
     Used commonly in the Web Technology world, connection with DECADA can be performed through a comprehensive set of RESTful APIs which can be easily accessed via HTTPS. Details of implementation can be found [here](https://support.envisioniot.com/docs/device-connection/en/latest/learn/connection_protocols/enos_http).

Agencies can refer to the [Appendix](https://siotteam.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DUG/pages/2264956988/Appendix) for more information.

Agencies to use the following flow chart to determine which protocol the sensors should use to connect to DECADA:

<div align=center>
<img width="850" src="./images/flowchart_protocol.png"/>
</div>

### Connection via Edge

<div align=center>
<img width="850" src="./images/snsp2.png"/>
</div>
DECADA Edge is a GovTech provided software solution which can be deployed on a x86/ARM
architecture either on-premises or as a virtual instance on the cloud. 

As a front end, DECADA Edge extends the capability of the platform via support for offline caching and conversion of various communication protocol such as:
 - ModbusTCP
 - ModbusRTU
 - IEC60870-5-104
 - DNP3.0
 - OPC-DA
 - OPC-XML-DA
 - OPC-UA
 - MQTT
 - DL/T645-2007
 - COAP
 - BACNET
 - DDS
 - HTTP(S)
 - DL/T645-1997

With these protocols, Agencies can easily create the data template of the device, which can then be directly used after simple configuration to avoid development or integration of protocols.
The **recommended** hardware requirements for edge hardware for the edge software installation is as follows:
 - Intel® AtomTM E3805 dual core 1.33 GHz / 1 MB or better
 - 2 x 10/100 Fast Ethernet (RJ-45).
 - Main port supports PoE (15.4W)
 - 3G/4G SIM Card Module or Ethernet based Internet access
 - USB: 1x USB 2.0, 1x USB 3.0
 - Wireless LAN: 2.4GHz, 802.11b/g/n/Bluetooth Low Energy 4.0
 - 2 GB Memory
 - Ubuntu Core 16
 - Serial to Ethernet adapter if Modbus RTU or DNP3 serial protocol is used
 - 128GB Storage

 ### Cloud-to-Cloud Connection with DECADA

<div align=center>
<img width="850" src="./images/snsp3.png"/>
</div>

In the event where direct link to DECADA is not possible, Cloud-to-Cloud connection is possible via a myriad of mechanism.
For example: 
 - Calling of RESTful APIs on 3rd Party Cloud (Pull).
   In this case, DECADA Cloud shall make periodic calls to the the 3rd Party Cloud to retrieve the required sensor data.
 - Calling of RESTful APIs on DECADA Cloud (Push)
   In this case, the 3rd Party Cloud shall utilize the DECADA RESTful APIs for pushing of sensor data to DECADA cloud. 
For more information, see [Message Integration](https://support.envisioniot.com/docs/device-connection/en/latest/learn/ingestion/index).

As Cloud-to-Cloud implementation is a project-specific solution, close collaboration will be required between both technical teams (GovTech & Agencies) to make it work.
In general, both teams will have to minimally agree to provide APIs for the following:
 - Access to sensor device attributes (Example: Device Id, Location, Type etc)
 - Access to sensor device data format via a unique identifier.
 - Access to sensor device measure points via a unique identifier.

*Note to team:*
1. Is there editable file to update “SDX”?
2. To confirm that it is not mandatory that only devices connecting via internet access is able to leverage on (1) mode of connection.
3. Understanding is that as long as device is able to support the following protocols, it doesn't have to meet the stated SDK?
4. There are more than the stated protocols (i.e. MQTT/CoAP/HTTPS) to integrate with DECADA for Edge Connection. Why none-SDK device method can only support 3? Or as long as the device is using protocol listed in the table (i.e. ModbusRTU), it is able to be compatible with DECADA?



## Device Connectivity

DECADA Cloud Platform is hosted in GCC Azure and is connectable via:
1. Internet
   - Agencies subscribing to Internet shall ensure the connectivity is TLS 1.2
   - Agencies shall provide public IP for whitelisting purpose
2. Private network (i.e. APN/VPN, MPLS)
   - Agencies shall subscribe to their own private APN & VPN and tag it to GovTech Cloud Connect
3. WOG Intranet Network
4. 3rd Party System
   - Agencies shall provide public IP for whitelisting purpose


<div align=center>
<img width="850" src="./images/High Level Net Arch.png"/>
</div>

Note to team:
1. For connection to GCC DECADA, does agencies need to subscribe to the cloud connect to connect to GCC DECADA?
2. Is there the editable version of this architecture to include 3rd party application connectivity?

## Device Registration

**<u>Overview</u>**

In the provisioning phase, Agencies will need to plan and design on ways to manage the endpoints. DECADA allows user to determine the **model** of the devices such as attributes and measure points for the device information, and also determine the device's **hierarchy** if required. DECADA also determines the **connection** scheme of the devices based on device's hardware designs, deployment methods or security requirements.

For devices on-boarding directly to DECADA. there are two ways of connection:
1. On-boarding smart devices to DECADA
2. On-boarding non-smart devices to DECADA

<div align=center>
<img width="850" src="./images/deviceregistration.png"/>
</div>


According to the above, deployed devices can be divided into 2 major categories:
Smart Devices: 
Support firmware burning, as well as direct connection to DECADA via Wi-Fi, GPRS, 3G, or 4G signals. A smart device can directly connect to and communicate with DECADA to complete authentication and data transmission.
Example: Surveillance cameras, and smart thermometers and hygrometers

Non-Smart Devices:
Do not support firmware burning, and lack the ability to connect to DECADA via Wi-Fi, 3G, or 4G. In this scenario, the devices need to connect through an edge gateway that is able to support firmware burning and network to DECADA. The data of these devices are then collected by the edge gateway. The device connected via this solution is also called the sub-device. The gateway serves as a proxy of the sub-devices to help them complete operations such as authentication, login, and data transmission.
Example: SCADA, Inverters

?> Agencies can leverage on either existing **DECADA Management Portal** or **API/SDK** to on-board their devices. See below.


**<u>Via DECADA Management Portal</u>**

Based on the selected connection scheme, Agencies will need to:

Register devices to obtain the device identities

<u>Step 1: Defining a Model</u>

A model is an abstraction of the product’s features, and defines what the product is, what it can do, and what services it can provide. This section shows how to create a model and define custom features for the model.

<div align=center>

Attributes of End-Points
-->

Agencies may refer [here](https://www.envisioniot.com/docs/device-connection/en/latest/howto/model/creating_model.html) for more information.

<u>Step 2: Creating a Product</u>

A product is a collection of devices with the same features. Using the device model as a base, a product further defines the communication specifications for the device.

Agencies can refer [here](https://www.envisioniot.com/docs/device-connection/en/latest/howto/device/creating_product.html) for more information.


<u>Step 3: Registering a Device</u>

A device is the instance of a product. It is created from a product so that it inherits not only the basic features of the model, but also the communication features of the product (for example, the device key-secret pair and device certificate used for secure communication).

</div>
Creation of Devices(Credentials)
-->

Agencies can refer [here](https://www.envisioniot.com/docs/device-connection/en/latest/howto/device/creating_product.html) for more information.

Use device SDKs to perform device-end development so that devices are authenticated to the cloud and start to transmit data.
The sample codes below shows the connection initiated from devices to be connected to DECADA:

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **Code**
``` 
    while __name__ == '__main__':
    client = MqttClient(str("tcp://mqtt.decada.gov.sg:11883"), "Product Key", "Device Key", "Device Secret")
    client.get_profile().set_auto_reconnect(True)  # if connection interrupted, the client can automaticlly reconnect
    client.setup_basic_logger('INFO')
    client.connect()
```
<!-- tabs:end -->
<!--
Measurement points received from devices can be seen from DECADA
<div align=center>
<img width="850" src="./images/device_auth.png"/>
</div>
Devices authenticated successfully

The sample codes below show the devices is generated randomized measurement point to DECADA: 

<!-- tabs:start -->
<!--#### **Code**
```
     measure_point_request = MeasurepointPostRequest.builder() \
     .add_measurepoint('HDB_RT_Current', random.randint(1001, 2001)) \
     .set_timestamp(int(time.time() * 1000)) \
     .build()
      measure_point_response = client.publish(measure_point_request) # publish request and wait for the response
      if measure_point_response:
        print("Generated data by Fridge meter")
```
-->
<!-- tabs:end -->



<!--Measurement points received from devices can be seen from DECADA-->

## Managing Asset Tree

**<u>Overview</u>**

Asset tree is a key function of the Asset Management service of DECADA. Asset tree is mainly for asset owners who understand the enterprise asset management business where they can quickly create the asset topology to manage assets in the cloud.

?> Agencies can leverage on either existing API/SDK or the DECADA Management Portal to create the Assets Tree


**<u>Via DECADA Management Portal</u>**

Agencies may refer [here](https://www.envisioniot.com/docs/device-connection/en/latest/howto/asset_tree/assettree_overview) for the details to create and utilize the assets tree via the DECADA Management Portal.

## Data Format

**<u>Overview</u>**

The endpoints transmit data to the cloud as per the attributes, measurement points, events, and services defined in the model. DECADA supports the data in both DECADA standard JSON format and custom format.

In the event that Agencies are unable to ingest data via the standard JSON format, Agencies can refer to the following “Custom Format” for more information.

**<u>DECADA Standard Data Format</u>**

Agencies are preferable to transmit data using the DECADA standard JSON format.

</div>

The sample codes below show the standard data format used for uploading data into DECADA:

#### **Code**
```
{
        "id": "123",
        "version": "1.0",
        "params": {
                "measurepoints": {
                        "Power": {
                                "value": 1.0,
                                "quality": 9
                        },
                        "temp": 1.02,
                        "branchCurr": [
                                "1.02", "2.02", "7.93"
                        ]
                },
                "time": 123456
        },
        "method": "thing.measurepoint.post"
}
```

The sample code below show the standard data format used for issuing data from DECADA to endpoints :
<!-- tabs:start -->
#### **Code**
```
{
        "id": "123",
        "version": "1.0",
        "params": {
                "temperature": 30.5
        },
        "method": "thing.service.measurepoint.set"
}
```
<!-- tabs:end -->

In the above-mentioned sample codes:
 - id refers to the message ID.
 - version refers to the protocol version.
 - The JSON arrays packaged by params refer to the data to be transmitted.
 - method refers to the request method.

**<u>Custom Format</u>**

The JSON format-based data communication with DECADA is not suitable for the endpoints with lower configurations and limited resources or those with special requirements on networking traffic. In this case, Agencies can pass the data to DECADA where DECADA will runs the parsing scripts to convert the data into the JSON format defined by DECADA. When the DECADA sends the control commands to the endpoints , the scripts may also be used to convert the JSON format defined by DECADA into the binary data that the endpoints is able to parse for issuing purpose.

</div>

For the endpoints that transmit the data by means of pass-through or in the custom format, Agencies may compile scripts in DECADA to parse the data from the endpoints. The parsing scripts support JavaScript-based development.
The DECADA parser provides the following capabilities.
1. Editing script online, and supports the validation of JavaScript syntax.
2. Upstream & downstream messaging simulation and debugging, and supports the viewing of simulation result.
3. Runtime environment after the publishing of script can be invoked for upstream & downstream messaging.
