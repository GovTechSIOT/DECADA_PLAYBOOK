 # Data Security

**<u>Overview</u>**

DECADA has existing mechanism implemented for protecting data at rest. Sensitive data is encrypted before putting into files or databases. Data is encrypted with keys generated by DECADA. Decryption happens automatically when data is retrieved through the DECADA API. Therefore, no intruders or platform operators will have access to the data even when they have access to the underlying file system or database systems, unless they have obtained the decryption keys.

Within DECADA, data (such as files and databases) belonging to different accounts (the “OU”) are stored separately or segmentally. Logical data segmentation is established in all underlying components of DECADA. In DECADA big data storage system, all files, tables, and other types of data are secured by access control, although data from different customers are stored physically in a single cluster. Only authorized users may access the data with audit-enabled API calls or command tools. This mechanism not only promotes the security of data, but also makes it possible to share data among different customers without extra storage cost.

?> For Devices Layer: It is dependent on the devices capability to encrypt its data at rest/in transit to DECADA. However channel encryption of TLS1.2 is implemented minimally. 

?> For Cloud Layer: Data at rest residing in database and in transit are encrypted with XXX standard.
