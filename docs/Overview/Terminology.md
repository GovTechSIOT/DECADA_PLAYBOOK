| Data Development            | Data development refers to a series of data computing processes (including data generation, collection and storage, data analysis and processing, data extraction and display, etc.) designed based on specific business needs. These computing processes are implemented as one or more scheduling jobs, and processing results are executed and output through a scheduling system.  |
| Data Storage                | Device origin data and calculated data can be stored in the target storage system based on the configured storage policies. According to data types and usage, data can be stored in different systems, for different storage time, and be retrieved by different methods.                                                                                                             |

| Data Type                   | Data ingested from different devices and sensors are of different types. DECADA Data Asset Management supports the analysis and storage of multiple types of data, including AI, DI, PI, and generic types. The data types of measure points are defined when creating device models.                                                                                                  |
| Dataset                     | A dataset is a logical table or view that establishes a connection with a source table by simple logical processing based on one or more data source tables. It can be directly associated with the charts in report design. By using datasets, users no longer need to care much about the processing logics of the underlying data source tables.                                    |
| Device                      | A device is a physical device that is subordinate to a product. A device has a unique device key assigned by DECADA.

With IAM, you can create and manage users and control who has access or operational permissions to what resources of the organization.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| IoT Hub                               | The IoT Hub is a cloud access service provided by DECADA for device access. A smart device can establish a secure two-way link with the cloud IoT Hub through the mainstream IoT protocol (MQTT protocol) to quickly build an IoT project or application.                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| Job                                   | A job (or a scheduling job) is the main object of data development and the main carrier of the data computing processes. It includes computing logics, computing dependencies, and scheduling properties. All the data resources related to data computing such as codes, scripts, or orders are concatenated in one or more dependent scheduling jobs and executed according to the scheduling attributes, ultimately producing processing results.  |

| Message Queue                         | A message queue is a container in which messages are saved during transmission. After the message is sent by the sender, it first enters a container for temporary storage. When a certain condition is met, the container is sent to the receiver. This is also called delayed communication of messages.                                                                                                                                            |

| Service Account   | A service account is the account that DECADA assigns to an application or service. The service account uniquely identifies an application. The service account is required when calling DECADA APIs to access the DECADA resources and when accessing subscribed asset data through DECADA SDK.                                                                            |
| Service           | Capability or method that can be called externally (i.e. Command to issue, Job to perform)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Stream Computing  | Stream computing is a way of processing data (in most cases, infinite data). Generally, message queues are used as data sources. It takes data records as processing units, and a record is sent downstream immediately upon completion of a calculation job. Jobs for stream computing are usually long tasks, which run continuously for data reception and processing.  |
| Stream Data       | Stream data consists of a series of discrete and endless events and is generated continuously by a lot of data sources. The common sources of stream data can be the devices connected to a data center, the telemetry data of devices, and the log files generated by mobile or web applications.                                                                         |
| Structured Data   | Structured data, or row data, is a logically expressed and implemented data from a two-dimensional table structure, typically stored in a database (such as MySQL, Oracle), or in a text file (such as CSV, TXT).                                                                                                                                                          |
| Sub-Device        | A sub-device is a physical device that is subordinate to a product. A sub-device connects to DECADA through a gateway.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Subscribe         | Subscribe is a type of operation permission for Topics, with permission to acquire messages from Topic queues. DECADA data subscription service supports subscription to real-time asset data and asset alert data, thus improving the API calling efficiency of applications with active data push.                                                                       |

| X.509 certificate service  | In cryptography, X.509 is a standard that defines the format of the public key certificate, which is an electronic document used to prove the ownership of a public key. DECADA provides the X.509 Certificate Service to enforce X.509 certificate-based bi-directional authentication for all communication sessions between the Edge and DECADA.  |
